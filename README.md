> A calendar management app born out of frustration with Jira and Clockify 😔

- Koano is a modern calendar management tool built to eliminate the friction of juggling work tools like Jira, Notion, and Clockify. Designed with powerful UI interactions and developer-first principles, Koano centralizes your schedule, tasks, and time tracking into a single intuitive interface.

## Why Koano?

Juggling multiple tools for time management, project planning, and tracking is painful. Koano brings your calendars, tasks, and timesheets into one powerful and minimal interface — freeing you from the mess of switching between Jira, Notion, Clockify, and others.
